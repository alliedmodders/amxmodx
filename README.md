**AMX Mod X** is a [Metamod](https://github.com/jkivilin/metamod-p) plugin for [Half-Life 1](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/halflife). It provides comprehensive scripting for the game engine and its mods. Scripts can intercept network messages, log events, commands, client commands, set cvars, modify entities, and more. AMX Mod X also has a system for extending native scripting through modules, leading to outside support for things like MySQL and Sockets. The AMX Mod X scripting language is called Pawn (formerly "Small"), and is officially maintained by [ITB CompuPhase](https://github.com/compuphase/pawn).
