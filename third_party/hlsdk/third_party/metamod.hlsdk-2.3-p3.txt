This is HL SDK 2.3 source (hl_sdk_v23_source.exe), with various fixes
in order to address some issues I ran into:
 - Reduce/remove g++ warnings/complaints, so I can compile my Mod code with
   lots of error checking ("--Weffc++ -Werror", etc) in order to catch
   problems in my own code.
 - Enable compiling win32 binaries under linux with mingw32 (gcc 2.95).
 - Remove complaints from vim about missing newlines.

Specific changes:
 - Converted from dos (CRLF) to unix (LF) format for *.txt, *.cpp, *.c, *.h.
 - Added missing EOF newlines.
 - Missing BOOL for HasWeapon declaration.
 - GNU g++ complaints: shadowed variables, testing undefined macros,
   empty initialization lists in constructors, unused variables, 
   and a couple other "Effective C++" recommendations.
 - Mingw issues: unrecognized #pragma's.

Changes from Valve LLC:
 Between the original release of the hl_sdk_v23_source.exe and now,
 Valve LLC has made various updates to the SDK 2.3 without releasing
 a new SDK version. These updates have been included in this version
 of the SDK. They are specifically:
 - Addition of pfnGetPlayerAuthId to enginefunc_t struct in eiface.h
 - Addition of various other functions to the enginefunc_t struct in
   eiface.h (mostly CS:CZ related).
 - Addition of the files multiplayer/engine/Sequence.h and
   multiplayer/engine/archtypes.h
 - The signatures of five functions in the enginefunc_t struct and
   the type of one member of the KeyValueData struct in eiface.h were
   changed.
 - Addition of pfnQueryClientCvarValue to enginefunc_t struct and
   pfnCvarValue to NEW_DLL_FUNCTIONS struct.

Other notes:
 - Renamed toplevel dirs to remove spaces as they were causing me some
   annoyances, ie:
      "Multiplayer Source" to "multiplayer"
      "Single-Player Source" to "singleplayer"
 - Focused on making the above changes to the sourcecode I include and/or
   view frequently; thus, the focus was on the serverside multiplayer code.
   The singleplayer and clientside (cl_dll) files may not have all the
   above changes applied.

There's a unified diff patch in the file:
   metamod.hlsdk-2.3.patch
as well as the *.orig files in the tar for comparison.
