This is HL SDK 2.3 source (hl_sdk_v23_source.exe), with various fixes
in order to address some issues I ran into:
 - Reduce/remove g++ warnings/complaints, so I can compile my Mod code with
   lots of error checking ("--Weffc++ -Werror", etc) in order to catch
   problems in my own code.
 - Enable compiling win32 binaries under linux with mingw32 (gcc 2.95).
 - Remove complaints from vim about missing newlines.

Specific changes:
 - Converted from dos (CRLF) to unix (LF) format for *.txt, *.cpp, *.c, *.h.
 - Added missing EOF newlines.
 - Missing BOOL for HasWeapon declaration.
 - GNU g++ complaints: shadowed variables, testing undefined macros,
   empty initialization lists in constructors, unused variables, 
   and a couple other "Effective C++" recommendations.
 - Mingw issues: unrecognized #pragma's.

Changes from Valve LLC:
 Between the original release of the hl_sdk_v23_source.exe and now,
 Valve LLC has made various updates to the SDK 2.3 without releasing
 a new SDK version. These updates have been included in this version
 of the SDK. They are specifically:
 - Addition of pfnGetPlayerAuthId to enginefunc_t struct in eiface.h
 - Addition of various other functions to the enginefunc_t struct in
   eiface.h (mostly CS:CZ related).
 - Addition of the files multiplayer/engine/Sequence.h and
   multiplayer/engine/archtypes.h
 - The signatures of five functions in the enginefunc_t struct and
   the type of one member of the KeyValueData struct in eiface.h were
   changed.

COMPATIBILITY NOTE:
 The change of the function signatures (see above) breaks compatibilty
 with older versions of the SDK. At least Linux servers are known to crash
 when you load a DLL which has been compiled against the old version of
 the engine interface into a server with the new engine interface. 
 By default the eiface.h in this SDK version uses the new, changed 
 engine interface. A compile-time switch has been added which lets you
 select the old engine interface should you want to compile your dll
 for older server engine versions (i.e. WON servers). To compile with
 the old engine interface, define the macro HLSDK_3_2_OLD_EIFACE.

Other notes:
 - Renamed toplevel dirs to remove spaces as they were causing me some
   annoyances, ie:
      "Multiplayer Source" to "multiplayer"
      "Single-Player Source" to "singleplayer"
 - Focused on making the above changes to the sourcecode I include and/or
   view frequently; thus, the focus was on the serverside multiplayer code.
   The singleplayer and clientside (cl_dll) files may not have all the
   above changes applied.

There's a unified diff patch in the file:
   metamod.hlsdk-2.3.patch
as well as the *.orig files in the tar for comparison.
